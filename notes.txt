in services property you can name services as you want e.g.
services:
  frontend:
  backend:
  database:

or

build/image:

  web:
    build: ./fronend # it's relative path to folder which contains Dockerfile, build property just build an image

  db:
    image: mongo:4.0-xenial # it's reference to existing image in dockerhub, it's second option to build an image, -xenial is version for linux less weight than

port:

  web:
    ports:
      - 3000:3000 #host(port declared in js file):docker container running this image

enviroment: variables for service

  api:
    environment:
      DB_URL: mongodb://db/example

volumes:

  db:
    volumes:
      - vidly:/data/db   # vidly is name of mongo db app(path to folder app), :/data/db is a docker path where this volume will be copied

image_path:/your_docker_compose_path
